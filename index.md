### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3 was one of my favorite labs because it helped me remember all that I learned in highschool about coding. It remindedme why i enjoyed coding in highschool and decided to major in it for college. I learned the differences between C++ and JavaScript and learned that they are similar in many ways. I was able to see how the run and compile errors worked in C++ and how to fix them as opposed to JavaScript as well.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 3 was one of my favorite labs because I had never coded anything that created a moving animation before. I did not know that you could read in files that created animations in the terminal before this lab and I thought it looked cool. I learned how to open files to read and/or write in them. This is something I had never done previously and never even considered something that was possible.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 3 was one of my favorite labs because I had never created my own program that could create and show you a png. It makes me wonder how you can make more complex images instead of just colors like we did in the lab. I learned how to output something in a PNG format instead of text on the terminal.
